[*HOW IT LOOKS*](https://ca2los.github.io/teamgen/)
VERSION 1.0

### *Team Generator*
The main idea of this project is allow you to *automate the creation of an index.html file* containing
the full data of a web development team. Just in a few steps and without coding a single line, you will
be able to create the file by entering the data from the command line. Everytime you execute the program, 
Team-Gen will create a html file with the data you selected.

### Installation
In order to run *Team-Gen*, you must make sure **Node JS** and **NPM** are already
installed in your computer.

#### *Node JS*
To check if **Node JS** is already installed, from your `Terminal Console` enter the
command `node -v` and press the **ENTER** key. It will show you a message with the
version of Node only if the package was installed before. If the message is different,
[click the link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the recommended version of the
package and install it.

#### *NPM*
To check if **NPM** is already installed, from your `Terminal Console` enter the
command `npm -v` and press the **ENTER** key. It will show you a message with the
version of Node only if the package was installed before. If the message is different,
then enter the command `npm install`and press the **ENTER** key.

### How to use it
From your terminal console, go through your files and locate the folder you want
to work with. Now enter the command `npm init -y` and press the **ENTER** key. Now
do the same with the command `npm i inquirer --save` and press the **ENTER** key. 

Once the packages are installed, from your terminal console and in the same folder
run the command `node index.js`and press ENTER. Finally, when the program starts you 
will need to access the requested data and press ENTER every time you finish.

```text
    // Command to initialize the program
    $ node index.js
    
    // Now the program asks you to start filling with data
    ? Name of the team: 
```

#### *WHAT IT DOES?*
1. The `npm init -y` creates a new JSON file loading the main settings of NPM libraries.
2. While `npm i inquirer --save` adds the library **Inquirer** into the JSON generated
   by the previous command.

changes to the project, and it's useful for testing the code.

### Contributions
Let me know if you are interested in upgrading the base code of the program. [Contact
me via GitHub](https://github.com/ca2los), and commit your changes by following the instructions:

#### Test your code with JEST
Before pushing your changes, you must share a screenshot of the test generated by JEST. To begin with this process: 

1. You must run at you terminal the command `npm install --save-dev jest`. 
2. When the installation has finished, take a look at your `package.json` file and make sure the instruction `"test": "jest"` is inside `scripts`. If not, copy the code and paste it.
3. Now run the command ´npm run test´ and if the program shows you no errors, take a screenshot and add it in your push to make sure the code is OK.

#### Make sure you have something like the image below:

### Testing
The code is still upgrading. New options will be available like choosing between web development, software development,
and design. In the meanwhile, I'll keep you updated.
